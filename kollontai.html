        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Nearly 53 years ago today, on March 31st, 1872, one of the most prominent Bolshevik revolutionaries who participated in the Russian Revolution (and certainly the most influential female leader of the Revolution) was born. Alexandra Kollontai well deserves the status of landmark historical figure and pioneer for gender equality on the political landscape. Despite this fact, she is widely unknown to people who are cursorily familiar with the broad strokes of the Russian Revolution. Even by those who are deeply familiar with the subject, she may be “presented briefly as the advocate of the ‘glass of water theory of sex[ual intercourse]’” and then dismissed, as Barbara Evans Clements put it.
 </p>
<br>
<p> But Kollontai’s story and philosophy extends so much further than her thoughts about sex. One of the most important people in one of the most important events in history deserves to be given a more in-depth look at her life than a glance at what she thought about relationships.

</p>
<br>
<p>
Kollontai was born to a minor noble family in St. Petersburg in the Russian Empire. She was tutored at home, and when it came time for her to go to university, her parents refused to send her, ironically because they feared her becoming radicalized. This would not stop her from becoming a revolutionary, of course.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Her parents wanted to arrange a marriage for her, but she despised this notion. She instead married an army officer her parents disapproved of. Soon however, Alexandra herself would disapprove of this marriage. She later described it as a “cage” to be a wife, and in 1898 left her husband to study in Switzerland (she kept his surname, though). 
</p>
<br>
<p>
In Switzerland, she joined the revolutionary circles her parents once feared her joining. She became a socialist, and would return to Russia to participate in the Revolution of 1905. Upon the achievements of this Revolution being largely undone by the Tsar, she fled into exile in 1908. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
She would eventually return to Russia after the Tsar’s deposition during the February Revolution in 1917 (the origins of which I covered in <a class="linkin" href="start-of-revolution.html">this article!</a>) and in the later October Revolution, would fight for socialist uprising on the side of the Bolsheviks.

    <br>
<p>
Kollontai was unique amongst Marxist revolutionaries and theorists for her focus on women’s oppression. She deviated from the historical materialist adherence of Marxists, which determined that for a socialist society to be established, the bourgeoisie (middle-class, rich members of society) would need to be given political power first (she joined Leon Trotsky in this line of thinking). Kollontai thought by skipping this stage, social revolution could immediately upend the historic oppression experienced by the female sex. Kollontai advocated that through communism, the individual would be dissolved, and “every member of society [could] expect society to take care of him.” This thought process led her to call for the dissolution of the traditional family structure, and “the collective” taking care of domestic duties. This would free women to become more politically active in society.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Kollontai’s ideas were truly revolutionary, even by revolutionary standards. As such, she was considered too radical by the radicals. Despite being placed into the important role of Comisar of People’s Welfare under Lenin, she would be targeted by Stalin upon his rise to power. Despite being spared from the executions he was so fond of, Stalin would politically isolate Kollontai by placing her in far-off diplomatic roles. Kollontai would pass away in Moscow in 1952. She was one of only three people a part of the Bolshevik’s Central Committee during the October Revolution who survived Stalin’s purges to the 1950s. The other two were Stalin and a devoted follower of his. Kollontai lived a remarkable, revolutionary life, and deserves to be more than a footnote in a history book. I encourage you to read more about her beyond this blog post!
