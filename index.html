        <p class="excerpt"><b>Author's Mission Statement:</b> Women throughout history are often marginalized, both by their contemporaries, and by history when they manage to have an impact. Throughout all of history's greatest events, women play a large part. This blog is dedicated to sharing the part women played in one such event, the Russian Revolution. Even though the role of even the most important women can be overshadowed by broader political narratives, it is important to make note of how women were active agents in the transformation of Russian (and, indeed) world society. Hopefully you are more informed about this conclusion after reading my articles! - Gustavo</p>

            <h2> Start of The Revolution</h2>
            <p class="date">February 23, 1917</p>
            <p class="excerpt">The Russian Revolution of 1917 was a world-changing event whose magnitude has few comparisons throughout history. It not only brought about the collapse of a three hundred year old dynasty and the third largest empire to ever exist, but eventually replaced it with a first of its kind radical state based on the principles of Marxism, which would also be one of the dominant superpowers of the 20th century.  What few know about the foundations of this world-changing event, however, was that it saw its start with a protest composed of women, on what is now International Women’s Day.

            <h2>The Most Prominent Red Daughter</h2>
            <p class="date">March 31, 1872</p>
            <p class="excerpt">Nearly 53 years ago today, on March 31st, 1872, one of the most prominent Bolshevik revolutionaries who participated in the Russian Revolution (and certainly the most influential female leader of the Revolution) was born. Alexandra Kollontai well deserves the status of landmark historical figure and pioneer for gender equality on the political landscape. Despite this fact, she is widely unknown to people who are cursorily familiar with the broad strokes of the Russian Revolution. Even by those who are deeply familiar with the subject, she may be “presented briefly as the advocate of the ‘glass of water theory of sex[ual intercourse]’” and then dismissed, as Barbara Evans Clements put it. But Kollontai’s story and philosophy extends so much further than her thoughts about sex. One of the most important people in one of the most important events in history deserves to be given a more in-depth look at her life than a glance at what she thought about relationships.
