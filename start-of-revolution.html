        <div class="article-content">
            <p>The Russian Revolution of 1917 was a world-changing event whose magnitude has few comparisons throughout history. It not only brought about the collapse of a three hundred year old dynasty and the third largest empire to ever exist, but eventually replaced it with a first of its kind radical state based on the principles of Marxism, which would also be one of the dominant superpowers of the 20th century. </p>
<br>
<p> What few know about the foundations of this world-changing event however, was that it saw its start with a protest composed of women, on what is now International Women’s Day. On the 23rd of February, 1917 (in the Old Russian/Julian calendar; to us it would be the 8th of March), tens of thousands of people, a majority of whom were women, gathered along the main street of the capital of the Russian Empire. They were really only gathered there, initially, to protest for more food, especially on the behalf of the masses of starving children. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The resources of the Russian Empire had been poured into feeding the fires of the First World War’s Eastern Front for three years by that point. For the people still at home, the horrors of war were doubled by the fact that their brothers, husbands, sons, fathers were being killed en masse, and those of them still at home were subjected to dwindling resources as a consequence of needing to feed the armies.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The crowds that February (really, March) day in 1917 were tired and starving. Soon more than 150,000 had gathered along the Main Street of Petrograd. This included women of all standings in society, from upper-class “ladies from society,” rural peasants, students, and textile workers. Soon, their demonstrations inspired the men of the city to join, and Petrograd ground to a halt. As the soldiers dispatched to take care of the protestors refused to fire on the crowds, the Tsar’s government was powerless in the face of mass revolt. By the end of the protests, the gathering demanded not just bread, but the abdication of the Tsar, setting a flurry of events in motion.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The fact that the Russian Revolution was commenced by the women of Petrograd, on International Women’s Day, was a milestone in the political participation of women in society, and the eventual magnitude of the Revolution displayed the force of women as a political force.  It is perhaps fitting that one of the most transformative events in all of history was sparked by what could be considered the most politically oppressed group historically. Women would go on to play major roles in the rest of the Russian Revolution, which you can read about in my other articles!
