        <div class="article-content">
            <p>The Russian Revolution was a time of great societal upheaval. The Communist Bolsheviks fought to totally upend the old model of how a state and society should function. Some social upheaval concerned the role of women in society, and their abilities to break the mold of traditional expectations of gender roles (Alexandra Kollontai was a notable thinker in this field, you can read about her <a class="linkin" href="kollontai.html"> here</a>.)</p>
<br>
<p> However, despite the completely radical thinking of the Bolsheviks, one of the greatest upheavals to the role of women actually came under the Provisional Government that formed after the overthrow of the Tsar during the February Revolution. This was the formation of the so-called Women’s Death Battalion, a military unit composed entirely of women who volunteered to fight for the Provisional Government during World War I. The battalion was created in response to the demoralization of Russian soldiers and the mass desertions that plagued the front lines. The Women’s Death Battalion was an unexpected development in a society that typically relegated women to domestic roles. However, unfortunately, the Battalion did not last long. By the end of the year the Bolsheviks would stage their uprising against the Provisional Government. The Women’s Death Battalion was one of the last assets of the military loyal to Kerensky during the October Revolution, and they were swept away by Bolshevik forces. The Bolsheviks would also pull Russia out of the First World War, marking an end to the need for such unique units.
